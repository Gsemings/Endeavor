# Endeavor

An adventure puzzle game where the player is a sorcerer's apprentice who finds themselves in a bizarre low-poly aesthetic world of magic and possibilities. The aim is for the player to enjoy the process of conquering challenges to unveil new supernatural abilities (such as innovative control of the elements around them) and take the time to practice and master them, which take full advantage of VR gesture recognition.
